This module uses the libraries xlrd, xlwt and xlutils
from http://www.python-excel.org in order to handle
XLS files in an easy way.

It provides the class XLSWriter which is able to either
modify an existing xls file or create a new one from
scratch or based on another one.


Example:

from devpower.xls import XLSWriter
 
# create a new XLS file
writer = XLSWriter()
writer.append(["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"])
writer.save("test.xls")
 
# modify an existing XLS file
writer = XLSWriter("archivo.xls")

# add a row at the end of the document
writer.append(["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"])

# search for the string "VALUE" in the first column
# and replace the row with the data given in the list
writer.replace(0, "VALOR", ["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"])

# write data at row 5 (index 4)
writer.write(4, ["Col1", "Col2", "Col3"])

# save changes to file
writer.save()

# or save them to a new one
writer.save("new.xls")
